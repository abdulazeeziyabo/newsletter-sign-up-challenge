## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

I was proud of this css which i learnt while doing this project.
```css
.check-image{
    background:linear-gradient(to right, #ff105f, #ff6257)}
```
I was able to use EventListener and arrow function which I am currently learning
```js
success.addEventListener( "click", (e)=>{})
```



### Continued development
I am learning JS and my focus currently is on EventListener, Arrow function. I was not able to validate the email, these and more areas are what I was to perfect.
